## Improvements and remarks

This addon is pretty minimalistic isn't it ? The reason of his born was first for 
education and next cause i did'nt find a way to make run more usefull but complex 
projects who could serve this purpose, i'll see in a near time if tree project like 
will work more easily with latest version of ember.
